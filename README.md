TEAM WORKFLOW STRATEGY <br />
A develop branch is created from main <br />
A release branch is created from develop after sanity is passed <br />
Feature branches are created from develop <br />
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch and corresponding feature branch is deleted <br />
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and main <br />
If an issue in main is detected a hotfix branch is created from main <br />
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and main and deleted <br />
