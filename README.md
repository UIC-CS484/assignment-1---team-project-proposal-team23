TEAM WORKFLOW STRATEGY 
A develop branch is created from main
A release branch is created from develop after sanity is passed
Feature branches are created from develop
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch and corresponding feature branch is deleted 
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and main
If an issue in main is detected a hotfix branch is created from main
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and main and deleted
